# Content--based-recommander
A content-based recommender works with data that the user provides, either explicitly (rating) or implicitly (clicking on a link). Based on that data, a user profile is generated, which is then used to make suggestions to the user. As the user provides more inputs or takes actions on those recommendations, the engine becomes more and more accurate.
